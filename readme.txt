This is a simple gradebook based on jQuery, javascript, mySQL and php.

== Description ==

After the plugin is installed, simply insert the short code [GradeBook] on any page that you would like the gradebook to be displayed.

Admin will have access to (almost) full CRUD implementation:
1) add/delete student,
2) add/delete course,
3) add/delete assignment.

Students will have access to:
1) their grades, and
2) basic stats for assignments. So far there is a pie chart that will display when a student clicks on an assignment cell. The pie chart is split up over the number of A's, B's, C's, etc...

Highlighted features:
1) No reloading. jQuery allows all the above functionality without reloading the page.
2) edit course names, semester, year, student names, grades, etc... in place, just hit return or click away to save inputs to the database.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip in the plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin in the installed plugins page of the admin panel.
3. Place shortcode [GradeBook] anywhere you would like the gradebook to appear.

I am not a programmer.  I understand that some of the code isn't efficient or elegant but I will work to making it so (as best I can).  Any help would be much appreciated. 



== Misc ==

I am an educator that wanted a nice plugin to record grades.  This plugin is a first attempt at doing just that.  There are still more features that should be added and that I want to add.
