This is a simple gradebook based on jQuery, JS, mySQL and php.

== Description ==

After the plugin is installed, simply insert the short code [GradeBook] on any page that you would like the gradebook to be displayed.

Admin will have access to (almost) full CRUD implementation:
1) add/delete student,
2) add/delete course,
3) add/delete assignment.

Students will have access to:
1) their grades, and
2) basic stats for assignments. So far there is a pie chart that will display when a student clicks on an assignment cell. The pie chart is split up over the number of A's, B's, C's, etc...

Highlighted features:
1) No reloading. jQuery allows all the above functionality without reloading the page.
2) edit course names, semester, year, student names, grades, etc... in place, just hit return or click away to save inputs to the database.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip in the plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin in the installed plugins page of the admin panel.
3. Place shortcode [GradeBook] anywhere you would like the gradebook to appear.

== Disclaimer ==

I am not a programmer.  I will work to make the code as efficient as possible (as best I can).  Any help would be much appreciated. 



== Misc ==

I am an educator.  This plugin is a first attempt at a nice plugin to record grades.  There are still more features that I want to add and will add over time.
